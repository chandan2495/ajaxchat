  <p>This is a collection of some of the nice Logic Puzzles that I have come
	 across and I recollect. Some that I found particularly hard are 
	 mentioned at the end under the <a href="#hard">Hard Difficulty</a> 
     section.
  </p>

  <div class="title">
    Easy / Medium Difficulty
  </div>

  <ol>
    <li>You are given 10 bags of gold coins each containing 10 coins
	    each. Also, it is given that each of the 9 bags contains coins of
		weight 1g each, and the 10th bag contains coins of weight 1.01g 
		each. Also, an infinite number of good coins and a digital relative 
		balance of infinite precision is provided. Using the relative 
		balance only once find out which bag contains the faulty coins!
	</li>
  
	<li>You are given an infinite number of non-uniform ropes(ropes of
		non-uniform cross sectional area at any place you cut them). 
		Also, it is given that once you start burning a rope, it will 
		finish burning in 60min. However, since the rope is non-uniform, 
		half the rope will not necessarily burn in 30min. Now, how would 
		you measure exactly 30min and 45min using such ropes which are 
		each non-uniform, but not identical. However, they all burn in 
		60min.
	</li>

    <li>Bobby has 100 lockers numbered 0 to 99, and has kept the keys to
		his bike and car in 2 of them. He, however being a very forgetful
		person has forgotten which those 2 locker numbers are! He however 
		does remember that when he reversed the digits of the first number, 
		the second number appeared. He also remembers that when he adds 
		the 2 locker numbers he gets a perfect square as the answer. Also, 
		on taking the difference of the 2 locker numbers, he gets a perfect 
		square as the answer. Find the 2 locker numbers.
	</li>

    <li>Bobby has kept the keys of his friend's bike and car in 2 other
		lockers which he had forgotten again! He however, as usual does
		remember that when he reversed the digits of one of the locker 
		numbers, he got the 2nd one! He also remembers that on taking the 
		sum of the 2 locker numbers, he got a perfrect square, and on 
		taking the difference of the 2 locker numbers, he got a perfect 
		cube as the answer. Find the 2 locker numbers.
    </li>

    <li>While leaving the house, Bobby remembers to take the house keys
		with him. So, he enters the room where he has kept the house keys.
		There are many rectangular boxes(cuboids) in this room, and Bobby 
		has kept the house keys in one of them, but has forgotten which 
		one! He however does remember that the box was such that when he 
		found the volume of the box in cubic units, it was numerically 
		equal to the sum of the surface area of each side of the box in 
		square units. Also, the dimensions of the cuboid are such that each 
		of them is a Natural number, and each dimension is distinct and a 
		non-prime. Find which box Bobby has placed the keys in!
	</li>

    <li>You are given a 4-digit number such that the sum and product of
		its digits are equal. Also, the number itself is divisible by the 
		sum or product(because they both are equal). The number is not 
		&quot;0000&quot;. Find the number.
	</li>

	<li>You are given 7-digits. When the first 3 digits taken as a
		3-digit number are added to 447, the result is the next 3 digits. 
		When the last 3-digits are added to 447, the result is the first 
		3-digits. Find the 7-digits.
	</li>

    <li>You are given 1023 apples, and 10 crates. Divide the apples such
		that suppose the customer asks you for any number of apples, you 
		are able to give him/her exactly that many number of apples using 
		an integral number of crates.
	</li>

	<li>2 towns A and B are 20-miles apart along a straight line. 2
		motorcyclists are standing at towns A and B facing each other. 
		There is a fly sitting on motorcyclist A&apos;s nose. The 2 motorcyclists 
		each ride at the speed of 10mph, and the fly flies at the rate of 
		15mph. The 2 motorcyclists start off simultaneously from their 
		respective initial points, and simultaneously, the fly sitting on 
		motorcyclist A&apos;s node starts flying in the direction of motorcyclist 
		B. When it touches the motorcyclists' nose, it turns and goes back to 
		motorcyclist A. On reaching his node, it turns back again, and continues 
		this routine. How many miles will the fly have covered before it gets 
		crushed between the noses of the 2 motorcyclists?
	</li>

    <li>You are given 16 light bulbs arranged in a circle. You are also
		given a push switch. When ever you push the switch, the state of the
		bulbs changes according to the constraints: If the state of a bulb and
		it&apos;s clockwise neighbour is the same(both ON or both OFF), then 
		the new	state of the bulb will be ON. If however, the state of the 
		bulb and its clockwise neighbor is opposite(one ON and the other OFF 
		or vice-versa), then the new state of the bulb is OFF. Given ANY 
		initial states of the bulbs, the push switch must be pushed at least 
		X number of times so that no matter how many more times you push the 
		switch, the bulbs always remain ON. Find X.
	</li>

    <li>A teacher has 3 students and 5 caps. 3 caps are Green in color,
		and 2 are Red in color. He makes the 3 students A, B and C stand in a
		straight line such that A is first, followed by B and tailed off by C.
		Thus, C can see both A and B, but B can see only A, and A can see no
		one. He tells the 3 students to shut their eyes and places the 3 caps
		randomly on their heads. He then places the 2 remaining caps in his
		pocket where no one including himself can see them. Then he asks the
		students to open their eyes, and asks student C which cap he has on his
		head. C replies "I can't tell". He then moves on to student B and asks
		him the same question, which is answered in the same manner by the
		student as the previous one. He then moves on to the student A, and
		asks him the same question. However, student A is able to reply, and 
		tells the teacher the color of the cap he has on his head correctly! 
		What color cap did student A have on his head?
	</li>

    <li>You are given 4 coins out of which at most 1 is defective(ie.
		heavier or lighter than the remaining 3). You are also given an
		infinite number of good(non-defective) coins. Using a relative 
		scale balance at most 2 times, find out whether there is a defective 
		coin, and if there is any such coin, then determine whether it is 
		heavier or lighter than the remaining 3 coins.
	</li>

    <li>You are give 16 coins out of which at most 1 is defective Using
		the relative scale balance at most 4 times, determine whether there is
		a defective coin, and if there is any such coin, then determine whether
		it is heavier or lighter than the remaining 15 coins.
	</li>

    <li>You are given 9 coins out of which exactly one is defective.
		Using the relative balance at most 3 times, determine the defective
		coin.
	</li>

	<li>You are give 12 coins out of which exactly one is defective
        [either heavier or lighter]. Using the relative balance at most 3
        times, determine which coin it is and also wheteher it is heavier or
        lighter compared to the other 11.
    </li>

    <li>There are 2 students A and B. They are given 2 numbers n and n+1
        (A is given the number n and B the number n+1). However, neither of
        them knows what number the other has. They only know that the 2 numbers
        given to them are consecutive. A buzzer sounds every minute. Either
        student can say when the buzzer sounds whether he/she knows the number
        that the other student has. Which student will speak first, guessing
        correctly what number the other has, and after how many beeps?
    </li>

    <li>I have a certain number of 10 rupee notes, and a certain number
        of 1 rupee notes, such that both of these are at least 1 in number. The
        number of 1 rupee notes multiplied by the number of 10 rupee notes is
        equal to the total amount of money I possess in rupees. Also, the
        number of 10 rupee notes is not a prime number. How much money do I
        possess in rupees?
    </li>
  </ol>

  <div class="title">
    <a name="hard"></a>
    Hard Difficulty
  </div>

  <ol>
    <li>There are 2 numbers x and y such that 2 &lt;= x &lt;= 99 and 2
        &lt;= y &lt;= 99. There are 2 persons P and S such that P is given the
        product xy of the 2 numbers and S is given the sum x+y of the 2
        numbers. The following conversation takes place between both of them:
        <ol>
          <li>P: I don't know the 2 numbers.</li>
          <li>S: I knew you wouldn't know them.</li>
          <li>Ok, now I know the 2 numbers.</li>
          <li>Now I too know the 2 numbers.</li>
        </ol>
		<div class='after-list'>
          Find the 2 numbers, and show that the solution is unique.
		</div>
    </li>

    <li>There was once a man who had 2 daughters A and B. He converted
        his entire estate into 9 or 16 diamonds, and decided to give each
        daughter some diamonds. Suppose MAX denotes the maximum number of
        diamonds, and he gave daughter A X diamonds, then daughter B got MAX-X
        diamonds. What he did just before dying was to tell daughter A how many
        diamonds daughter B had, and he also told daughter B how many diamonds
        daughter A had. After he died, each daughter wanted to know how many
        diamonds she had gotten, so they had the following conversation:
        <ol>
          <li>A: Tell me how many diamonds I got.</li>
          <li>B: No first you tell me how many diamonds I got.</li>
          <li>Ok, I now how many diamonds I got.</li>
          <li>I too now know how many diamonds I got.</li>
        </ol>
		<div class='after-list'>
          How many diamonds were there in all, and how many did each of the
          daughters get?
		</div>
    </li>
  </ol>
