<p>
Many sites like <a href="../../www.reddit.com/default.htm">reddit</a>, and 
<a href="../../www.slashdot.org/default.htm">Slashdot</a> have ever changing
front pages. These are news/content sites whose front page is
continually refreshed, and new and latest content added all the time.
</p>

<p>Even the search result page for a <a
href="../../www.google.com/default.htm">Google</a> search will show different
results after their indexes are refreshed either because of a re-crawl
or because of change in page ranks, etc...
</p>

<p>If you want to share the front pages of these sites (and the
associated links and their relative ranks as you saw them), you'll
either have to copy and subsequently paste them into an email or a
file, or just hope that the ranks don't change before the intended
recipient sees the page.
</p>

<p>StickyLinks solves this problem by providing you with a
<b>sticky</b> which is basically a permanent link to that page's
content so that no matter when it is opened, it will be seen just the
way you intended it to be seen by the reader!!
</p>

<p>This way, you can email links to these dynamic pages and post them
on forums without the fear of their content changing.
</p>

<p>In fact, sticky was used by my sister to report a bug on sticky
itself. She saw some error, and I wasn't seeing it (because of the
page being in my browser's cache). So, she made a <a
href="getpage.php@key=dbe236ace488b1f158c11b70f7342b4c4b39e2ce86e109.83102205">sticky</a>
and sent it off to me, and I was able to see what she saw.
</p>

<p>
So go ahead and have fun with this tool!!
