<p>
When you enter a web-site URL to stickify, StickyLinks checks to see
if a snapshot (currently) up to 25 minutes ago exists or not. If so,
it shows you that sticky url, or else it creates a new sticky URL and
shows you that one.
</p>
<br/>

<ul>

<li><b>Does StickyLinks download images/CSS/javascript from the site?</b>
<p>No. StickyLinks just downloads the HTML content of the page whose
URL is specified, and converts all relative links to absolute ones so
that the external images/CSS/javascript is fetched from the original
site. What this means is that your page will look broken if any of
these above external entities changes. What it also means is that if
the developer fixes some bugs in these external dependencies, you'll
be able to use the fixed code for free!!
</p><br/>
</li>

<li>
<b>Does StickyLinks follow 302 redirects?</b>
<p>Yes</p><br/></li>

<li>
<b>Will StickyLinks work for all sites?</b>
<p>No, sites that generate the page data dynamically <em>may</em> not
work well. Having said this, more often than not, you will see the
page correctly since external javascript will be loaded. Also sites
that require you to <b>login</b> will not work with StickyLinks since
the StickyLinks server will not be able to login on your
behalf.</p><br/></li>


<li>
<b>Can web-sites block StickyLinks?</b>
<p>We currently use <em>Mozilla/4.0</em> as the User-Agent string to
make sure that only HTML content is served by the web-site <em>as far
as possible</em>. However, most web-sites don't serve content based on
the User-Agent. Furthermore, the HTTP <em>Referer</em> tag is set to a
value other than the original web-site's URL when external
images/CSS/javascript is fetched from the site. A site administrator
may block requests that either don't have a Referer set, or have a
Referer other than the original site's URL.</p><br/></li>


<li>
<b>I am a site admin and I want to remove old versions of my site's page from StickyLinks</b>
<p>Sure. Please drop me an email at <em>dhruvbird at gmail dot
com</em> with a subject line <em>StickyLinks: Request Removal</em>,
and mention in the email which web-site it is that you want
removed. This might take a while, but it will be done. The old links
will not go dead, but will point to some reasonable error
message, and a link to the original page.</p><br/></li>
